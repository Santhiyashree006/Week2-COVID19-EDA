# 📊 Week 2 Project – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 Dataset

## 🧑‍🎓 Internship: NSP Nexus Data Science Internship – Week 2

### 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global COVID-19 dataset using Python. We aim to understand trends, patterns, and draw visual insights from the data.

---

### 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [COVID-19 Data – GitHub (datasets/covid-19)](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19)
- **File Used**: `countries-aggregated.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `Date`
  - `Country`
  - `Confirmed`
  - `Recovered` (calculated)
  - `Deaths`

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

### 🔎 Key Analysis Steps
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
2. Performed EDA:
   - Displayed summary statistics
   - Checked null values and duplicates
   - Found the number of countries
   - Identified most affected countries
3. Visualized:
   - Line chart of global confirmed cases over time
   - Bar chart of top 10 countries by death count
   - Pie chart of global recovered vs deaths

---

### 📈 Key Insights / Observations
- The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose steadily over time.
- USA, Brazil, and India were among the most affected countries.
- Recovered cases outnumbered deaths globally.
